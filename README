THIS IS THE README FOR OUR CURRENT PROJECT, WHICH WILL BE UPDATED AS THINGS PROGRESS.

Git Reference : http://gitref.org/

PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU LOG CHANGES TO THE FILE THAT YOU CHANGES
To commit : git commit -m "A concise description"
IF it's a NEW file, please add the file first before committing.
To add : git add FILENAME or git add . (to add all)

Please PULL/FETCH OFTEN
It's best to always PULL before you begin your work.
It's better to FETCH than PULL. PULL will merge everything, while FETCH, you can monitor what you are merging. It's just safer to use.

To fetch : git fetch origin
Check difference : git diff master origin/master
To merge : git merge origin/master

To check the development log, use: git log
You can check what other members are doing and their commits from there.

After finishing your work, and ready to be shared with others, please push your work using: git push origin master
